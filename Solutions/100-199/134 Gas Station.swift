    /// Finds out if you can once travel around the circle in a clockwise direction.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - gas: The gas stations.
    ///   - cost: Gas costs for travel from station `i` to the next station (i + 1).
    /// - Returns: The starting gas station's index if you can travel, otherwise returns -1.
    ///
    /// - Complexity:
    ///   - time: O(n), where n is the number of gas stations.
    ///   - space: O(1), only constant space is used.
